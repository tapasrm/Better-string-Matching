# Better-string-Matching
A different approach to get a solution to string matching with O(n) time complexity.

I have added the program for Knuth Morris Pratt Algorithm and the new program, you can compare both the programs time taken on your machine.

Thierry Lecroq maintains a large array of string matching algorithms proposed by different people [here](http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~lecroq/string/).
I think BMH (Horspool in the list) is the fastest in most cases.

_The inputs for C and Python programs are hard coded. You need to change them manually._
